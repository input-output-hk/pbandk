# Gradle 6.3+ seem to require a larger metaspace size when run against this
# project. Otherwise the build crashes with an out-of-memory error. Can be
# removed when/if this is resolved on the gradle side.
#
# Gradle also needs more heap space to build this project than the default 1GB.
#
# IR compiler backend for Kotlin/JS requires a higher than default (1MB) stack
# size. Otherwise, there is a high chance of build crashing with stack overflow.
